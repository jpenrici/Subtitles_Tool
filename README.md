# SRT to MP3 Converter (Subtitles_Tool)

Convert subtitle files (`.srt`) into MP3 audio using **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**.
Pauses are automatically inserted based on subtitle timing.
A simple **PySide6** GUI is available to make the process easy!

---

## Features

- Converts `.srt` subtitle files into spoken `.mp3` files.
- Automatically inserts silent pauses matching the subtitle timing.
- Optionally saves each voice clip separately (`--voices` option).
